        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The integration of technology is exerting a substantial influence on the process of globalization, with drone technology emerging as a prominent example over the past decade. Drones have witnessed a remarkable increase in their usage across various disciplines, including agriculture, surveillance, healthcare, forestry, and military domains. The current international market of surveillance, search and rescue drones is 3254.4 Million US$ and it will potentially grow to 11,468 Million US$ till 2033. Most drones in use are outfitted with sensors and cameras, enabling the creation of specific applications and solutions across various domains. With the rapid advancement in drone technology and AI, there is an urgent need for professionals to stay abreast of the latest developments in real-time AI applications for drones. As drones continue to evolve and play a pivotal role in various industries, AI-powered visual data processing becomes imperative for extracting meaningful information and insights from the vast amount of data collected by drones including AI-on-the-Edge perspective. Specifically, trustworthiness in aerial computer vision is a multifaceted concept that demands an integrated approach to robustness, transparency, and ethical considerations. Building trust in these systems is crucial for their successful integration into various applications and gaining acceptance from users, stakeholders, and the wider public. Keeping in view the rapidly evolving landscape of drone technology and the pressing need for advanced real-time AI-based data processing, we have designed this tutorial to acquaint the audience with the latest tools, methods, and research trends in Edge AI applications for drone technology. As the tutorial delves into advanced methodologies, practical implementations, and real-world applications, participants will concurrently explore the ethical considerations, data privacy concerns, and responsible AI practices crucial for building trustworthy drone AI systems. The tutorial also aims to empower professionals not just with technical expertise but with a holistic understanding of the ethical dimensions associated with the deployment of drone AI technology.
